# What is this?

This was the program I wrote as part of my application for Zalora in March 2014.  For applicants like myself with little visible Haskell experience, we were asked to write a simple inventory management web application with the following requirements:

* Accept new product data via JSON request
* Product data must be stored in a database
* Images must be stored on the filesystem
* Display full list of products
* View a specific product along with its photograph

The sample.js file contains an example of the expected data for the JSON request.
